**CyberTOMP®** (Cybersecurity Tactical–Operational Management Process) is a framework designed to help organizations, particularly in the Public Sector, manage and evaluate cybersecurity in a holistic, asset‑focused way. It bridges the gap between strategic standards and the tactical/operational levels where cybersecurity actions truly take place.

## What is CyberTOMP®?
CyberTOMP® is a systematic methodology that:
- Uses the **business asset** as the basic unit of reference for cybersecurity.
- Provides **procedural guidance** for tactical and operational levels, ensuring alignment with strategic goals.
- Enables **holistic management**, integrating people, processes, technology, and supply chains.

## What is it used for?
CyberTOMP® is applied to:
- **Evaluate cybersecurity posture** across critical assets.
- **Guide decision‑making** with clear metrics and proportional effort based on asset criticality.
- **Facilitate collaboration** among multidisciplinary teams and external providers.
- **Support supply chain security**, extending cybersecurity requirements to outsourced services.

## Key Differentiators
- **Asset‑centric approach**: Focuses on protecting what truly matters: the business asset.
- **Holistic integration**: Breaks organizational silos, ensuring unity of action across departments and supply chains.
- **Compatibility with standards**: Works independently yet aligns seamlessly with existing strategic frameworks (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST, CIS CDM).
- **Procedural body**: Offers detailed processes, roles, responsibilities, and metrics for tactical and operational levels.
- **Optimization algorithms**: Incorporates technologies, like genetic algorithms, to calculate feasible cybersecurity states quickly and efficiently.
- **Practical tools**: Includes tools, like FLECO Studio, a lightweight, open‑source software that makes implementation tangible and user‑friendly and also helps to improve the cyber situational awareness of the team.
- **Supply chain coverage**: Extends cybersecurity management to outsourced SOC services and external providers.

CyberTOMP® transforms cybersecurity from a fragmented set of practices into a **coherent, measurable, and collaborative framework**, empowering organizations to face evolving cyber threats with confidence.
