The **CyberTOMP® framework** is composed of several subprojects that address different aspects. These range from the theoretical development of the model and the accompanying materials and guides, to the creation of software tools that support its practical application. All of them evolve in the usual way of any open‑source project, within Git repositories hosted on GitHub.

While these projects share a common governance umbrella, described in the various sections of this website, the specific documentation for each project can be accessed directly in its repository (see the [Projects](/projects) section).

## Where Should You Start?

It is common to follow these steps:

- Assess whether the CyberTOMP® framework is appropriate for your organization.  
- Follow the guides, materials, and recommendations to implement cybersecurity management based on CyberTOMP® within your entity.  
- Use the software tools developed to facilitate both the initial setup and the ongoing management process based on CyberTOMP®.  

The **CyberTOMP® framework core** project is precisely the digital, navigable version of the model. It includes forms to evaluate whether the framework is suitable for your specific case, as well as the guides and materials required for its implementation. This should be your first stop.  

The model’s documentation also references the various software tools created within the CyberTOMP® context. Each repository contains the necessary documentation for its use. Access them as needed, either through the guides found in the **CyberTOMP® framework core** project or directly via each project listed in the [Projects](/projects) section.  

## Need Additional Documentation?

If, beyond the official materials mentioned above, you require something more traditional, you may acquire books, manuals, or training materials produced by third parties. Ensure that such materials are authorized by the CyberTOMP® framework and correspond to the version of CyberTOMP® you plan to implement.
