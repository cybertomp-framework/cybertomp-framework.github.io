The **CyberTOMP® framework** is composed of several subprojects that address different aspects. These range from the theoretical development of the model and the accompanying materials and guides, to the creation of software tools that support its practical application. All of them evolve in the usual way of any open‑source project, within Git repositories hosted on GitHub.

While these projects share a common governance umbrella, described in the various sections of this website, the specific documentation for each project can be accessed directly in its repository (see the [Projects](/projects) section).
