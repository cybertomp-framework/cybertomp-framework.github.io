## Contributions

We love seeing community contributions! Before submitting, please make sure you have signed the Contributor License Agreement (CLA). All contributions should follow our governance principles to keep the framework reliable, relevant, and useful for everyone.

- **Continuous Improvement**: Help the framework evolve with new needs, technologies, and cyber threats, while staying true to its core values.  
- **Evidence-Based Evolution**: Back up your contribution with solid evidence—peer-reviewed publications are ideal, but other credible sources are welcome too. Opinions alone are not enough.  
- **Broad Applicability**: Aim for improvements that benefit a wide range of organizations and contexts, rather than very narrow or niche cases.  
- **Public Sector Priority**: The framework focuses on public sector needs. Private sector considerations are welcome only if they don’t compromise public requirements.

See [Governance](/governance) section for additional information.

### Submission Requirements

Please include a short justification report with your contribution. This report should explain how your submission aligns with the principles above and include any supporting evidence. The Steering Committee will review this report before accepting your contribution.

Your contributions help the framework grow stronger and more useful for everyone—thank you for helping us improve!
