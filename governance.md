## 1. **Purpose**

The purpose of this document is to establish clear guidelines for how the CyberTOMP® Framework evolves over time within an open and collaborative community. Rather than dictating adoption, this governance model focuses on ensuring that changes to the framework are transparent, inclusive, and aligned with its core principles. It provides a structure for decision-making that encourages innovation while maintaining consistency and integrity.

## 2. **Governance Principles**

The evolution of CyberTOMP® is guided by a set of principles that reflect the spirit of openness and collaboration:

*   **Transparency**: All decisions, discussions, and changes are documented and accessible to the community.
*   **Inclusivity**: Every member of the community has the opportunity to contribute ideas and feedback.
*   **Neutrality**: Decisions are made in the interest of the framework and its users, avoiding favoritism or commercial bias.
*   **Continuous Improvement**: The framework should adapt to emerging needs, technologies, cyberthreats and best practices without losing its foundational values.

## 3. **Scope**

This governance document applies to:

*   The process for proposing, reviewing, and approving changes to the whole framework and all its subprojects.
*   The roles and responsibilities of individuals and groups involved in its evolution.
*   Mechanisms for resolving disagreements and maintaining community harmony.

It does **not** govern:

*   How organizations implement or adopt CyberTOMP®.
*   Specific technical deployments or proprietary/derivative adaptations.

## 4. **Governance Structure**

The governance model is built around collaborative roles:

*   **Management Committee**: A group responsible for reviewing proposals, ensuring alignment with principles, and guiding strategic direction.
*   **Open Community**: Contributors who share ideas, provide feedback, and participate in discussions and voting.
*   **Facilitators**: Individuals who moderate conversations, manage collaborative platforms, and ensure smooth communication.

## 5. **Evolution Process**

The process for evolving CyberTOMP® is designed to be open and structured:

1.  **Proposal Submission**: Any community member can submit a change proposal through the official repository.
2.  **Review Phase**: The Evolution Committee evaluates the proposal for technical soundness and alignment with principles, while opening it for public comments.
3.  **Approval and Voting**: Decisions are made through transparent voting, with clear criteria for acceptance.
4.  **Publication**: Approved changes are documented and integrated into the official framework, with version notes and rationale.

## 6. **Community Participation**

Participation is the cornerstone of this governance model. Members can engage through:

*   Public forums and discussion channels.
*   Periodic surveys and voting sessions.
*   Collaborative documentation and feedback loops.

## 7. **Version Management**

To maintain clarity and stability:

*   Updates follow a predictable release cycle.
*   A public changelog records all modifications.
*   Backward compatibility is considered whenever feasible.

## 8. **Conflict Resolution**

Disagreements are addressed through:

*   Mediation by facilitators.
*   Escalation to the Management Committee if consensus cannot be reached.

## 9. **Transparency and Accountability**

Every decision and change is logged in a publicly accessible archive. Regular reports summarize the framework’s evolution, ensuring accountability to the community.

## 10. **Licensing and Intellectual Property**

CyberTOMP® operates under open licenses that guarantee free access and contribution. Contributors are acknowledged for their work, fostering a culture of recognition and respect.
