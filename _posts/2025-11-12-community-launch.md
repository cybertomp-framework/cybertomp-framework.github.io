Over the past months, we have received numerous requests from researchers and cybersecurity management practitioners worldwide to make the CyberTOMP framework more open and collaborative. Today, we are excited to announce that this vision is becoming a reality.

The **CyberTOMP® framework is now open to the community**, enabling the integration of features and improvements developed by experts across the globe. This step aims to foster innovation while maintaining the integrity and consistency that organizations, especially public entities, require.

### **Our commitment rests on three pillars:**

1.  **Openness and collaboration**  
    Not only granting free access and use of the CyberTOMP® framework, but also enabling the community to **actively contribute** with new features and improvements.
2.  **Security and trust**  
    Preventing misuse of the CyberTOMP® name and ensuring that any implementation requested by an organization strictly follows the official model, avoiding unofficial versions that exploit the name without adhering to the formal process established by CyberTOMP®.
3.  **Consistency and governance**  
    Guaranteeing that contributions are **research-driven and guided by formal processes**, preserving the integrity and standardization of the framework while embracing innovation.

To achieve this balance, the original authors of the model must safeguard homogeneity while embracing community-driven contributions. In pursuit of this goal, the **GÍTACA research group at the University of Extremadura** has worked intensively over recent months to design a **governance model for the framework**. This model ensures transparency, authenticity, and collaborative growth, and it has just been launched.

**Join us in shaping the future of cybersecurity governance. Together, we can build a stronger, standardized, and innovative ecosystem.**
